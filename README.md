Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Pewlett hackard is a large compnay boasting several thousand employees and it's been around for a long time. As baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate pewlett haggard is looking toward the future in two ways. First, it's offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria. Second, it's staring to think about which positions will need to be filled in the near future. The number of upcoming retirements will leave thousdands of job openings. What would happen to a compnay if they didn't look ahead and prepare for this many vacancies? It probably wouldn't be pretty. bobby is an up and coming HR analyst whose task is to perform employee research. Specificially, he needs to find answers to the following questions, who will be retiring in the few years, and how many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill? This analysis will help future-proof Pewlett Hackard by generating a list of all employees eligible for the retirement package. The employee data Bobby needs is only available in the form of six SCV files because Pewlett Hackard has been mainly using Excel and VBA to work with their data. But now they've fianlly decided to update their methods and instead use SQL, a definite upgrade considering the amount of data. Your task is to help Bobby build an employee database with SQL by applying your data modeling, engineering, and analysis skills.

Now that Bobby has proven his SQL chops, his manager has given both of you two more assignments: determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Then, you’ll write a report that summarizes your analysis and helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.
